# HelloKittyMagicalBlockDCEnglishPatch

Hello, this series of patches translates Hello Kitty Magical Block for the Sega Dreamcast into English. This game didn't have a huge amount of text but what little was in Japanese, is now in English. This includes:

Title screen, all cutscenes have English subtitles encoded onto them (https://github.com/DerekPascarella/Dreamcast-FMV-Auto-Subber great tool for this) and UI text boxes that WERE in Japanese (most were in English tbh)

These patches are for a GDI copy only, specifically one that has 6 files (they're named in the zip), I don't know how to adjust this for other versions (get in touch if you like/know), tested on FlyCast and deMul with no problems.

Thanks!
